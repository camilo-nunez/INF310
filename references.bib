TITLE = {YOLO-v1 to YOLO-v8, the Rise of YOLO and Its Complementary Nature toward Digital Manufacturing and Industrial Defect Detection},
JOURNAL = {Machines},
VOLUME = {11},
YEAR = {2023},
NUMBER = {7},
ARTICLE-NUMBER = {677},

ISSN = {2075-1702},
ABSTRACT = {Since its inception in 2015, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) variant of object detectors has rapidly grown, with the latest release of YOLO-v8 in January 2023. YOLO variants are underpinned by the principle of real-time and high-classification performance, based on limited but efficient computational parameters. This principle has been found within the DNA of all YOLO variants with increasing intensity, as the variants evolve addressing the requirements of automated quality inspection within the industrial surface defect detection domain, such as the need for fast detection, high accuracy, and deployment onto constrained edge devices. This paper is the first to provide an in-depth review of the YOLO evolution from the original YOLO to the recent release (YOLO-v8) from the perspective of industrial manufacturing. The review explores the key architectural advancements proposed at each iteration, followed by examples of industrial deployment for surface defect detection endorsing its compatibility with industrial requirements.},

  abstract = 	 {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flower (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}

ABSTRACT = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extended to hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification due to its better feature representation and high performance, whereas multiple feature learning has shown its effectiveness in computer vision areas. This paper proposes a novel framework that takes advantage of both CNNs and multiple feature learning to better predict the class labels for HSI pixels. We built a novel CNN architecture with various features extracted from the raw imagery as input. The network generates the corresponding relevant feature maps for the input, and the generated feature maps are fed into a concatenating layer to form a joint feature map. The obtained joint feature map is then input to the subsequent layers to predict the final labels for each hyperspectral pixel. The proposed method not only takes advantage of enhanced feature extraction from CNNs, but also fully exploits the spectral and spatial information jointly. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested with three benchmark data sets, and the results show that the CNN-based multi-feature learning framework improves the classification accuracy significantly.},

ABSTRACT = {Human action recognition plays a significant part in the research community due to its emerging applications. A variety of approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem, however, several issues still need to be addressed. In action recognition, effectively extracting and aggregating the spatial-temporal information plays a vital role to describe a video. In this research, we propose a novel approach to recognize human actions by considering both deep spatial features and handcrafted spatiotemporal features. Firstly, we extract the deep spatial features by employing a state-of-the-art deep convolutional network, namely Inception-Resnet-v2. Secondly, we introduce a novel handcrafted feature descriptor, namely Weber&rsquo;s law based Volume Local Gradient Ternary Pattern (WVLGTP), which brings out the spatiotemporal features. It also considers the shape information by using gradient operation. Furthermore, Weber&rsquo;s law based threshold value and the ternary pattern based on an adaptive local threshold is presented to effectively handle the noisy center pixel value. Besides, a multi-resolution approach for WVLGTP based on an averaging scheme is also presented. Afterward, both these extracted features are concatenated and feed to the Support Vector Machine to perform the classification. Lastly, the extensive experimental analysis shows that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy.},
